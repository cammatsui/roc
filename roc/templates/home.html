                        <p>There are hundreds of courses to choose from every semester, spanning 41 departments at the College. Until now, there hasnâ€™t been a way for you to survey those courses with specific qualities in mind. RoC Amherst allows you to rank courses by how interesting, difficult, and work-intensive they are, as well as by the quality of the professor- all according to your peers.</p>
